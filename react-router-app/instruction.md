I'm building a website to teach a professional course about react and typescript.
The website will contain a list of technical examples to explain the concepts.
These are the available libraries:

- react-router
- react-hook-form
- zod
- react-query
- zustand
- react-i18next
- i18next-http-backend
- i18next-browser-languagedetector
- shadcn
- tailwindcss

The project is already started, you can find the code.

I want to implement some examples of this features:

- [ ] Change the language
- [ ] Setup a zustand store with a simple counter
- [ ] Setup a context provider example with a simple counter
- [ ] Navigator example with params between pages
- [ ] react-hook-form with zod validation example
- [ ] react-query example with a public api
